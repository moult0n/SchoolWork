// CSE 240 Spring 2017 Homework 1 Question 4 (25 points)
// Before starting this assignment, please compile and run this program. 
// You will first notice that the program will not compile. Fix the errors and define the error types.
// Next, you will notice that the program is printing incorrect information. Fix the errors and define those error types.
