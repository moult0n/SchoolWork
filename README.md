# School Work
My school work from ASU from 2015-2017. Directories note the class name from ASU. All filenames have been changed to match the class and project/assignment they were a part of. This means that none of the code in these files will work unless the naming dependances are resolved. This is done to prevent easy submition of my work to the professors who teach these classes. 

The 'project_nbody_code' is a part of the ASU_MAT425 class, while the 'project_opinion_model' is a part of the ASU_MAT451 class.
