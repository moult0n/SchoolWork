% The omega value with the highest C value is at omega is about 1.87.
%%
% *(c)*
% To find the maxium of C we need to have the derivative of C equal to 0,
% which happens at the square root of 7/2 or 1.8708. This was the value I
% got for part b.

% *(d)*
% The amplitude of forced oscilation is -0.392. If omega was
% changed for LAB06ex1.m I would expect a lower value for any omega that
% was used.
