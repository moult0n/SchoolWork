% There is always about .08 n of energy at all times. The graph confirms
% that energy is conserved. However the system will reach energy equalt to
% .0001 just after 8 hours. Each cycle losses about 2.7710e-06 n of energy
% every cycle which is pretty close to 0.

% *(c)*
% Over the 10 second period the curve doesn't reach the origin. This is
% because the energy is constant.
