%% Exercise 1
%
%%
% *(a)*
% The period of forced oscillation is 4.4880 or 2*pi/omega for omega equal
% to 1.4. The numerical angle alpha is 0.601.
%%
% *(b)*
% The plot looks like an exponentiallly decreasing oscillation. After a few
% oscillations the plot decays to zero very quickly.

%% Exercise 2

% *(a)*

run l6e2a.m
%%
% *(b)*
% The omega value with the highest C value is at omega is about 1.87.
%%
% *(c)*
% To find the maxium of C we need to have the derivative of C equal to 0,
% which happens at the square root of 7/2 or 1.8708. This was the value I
% got for part b.
%%
% *(d)*
% The amplitude of forced oscilation is -0.392. If omega was
% changed for LAB06ex1.m I would expect a lower value for any omega that
% was used.

% *(e)*
% Changing the inital conditions does not change the outcome for C for any
% given omega.

%% Exercise 3
%
%%
% *(a)*
% The maximum amplitude is about 12.55 at omega equals 2 which is the same
% as omega not.

% *(b)*
% The solution exponential grows as it oscillates.

%%
% *(b)*
% The period for the fast oscillation is pi.
%%

% 
%%
% *(c)*
% The length of the beat function is 10*pi.
%%
% 
% <<4c.png>>
% 
%%
% *(d)*
% For omega equal to 1.9, the period of the fast oscillation is slightly larger than pi and the
% beat length is 20*pi. For omega equal to 1.6, the period of the fast
% oscillation is about pi and the beat length is 5*pi. When changing the
% omega value the period of the fast oscillation stays the same while
% increasing the distant between omega and omega not descreases the beat
% length.
