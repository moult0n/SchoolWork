% The blue curve represents y=y(t), you can clearly see this because the
% initial condition for y(0) is .1.

% *(b)*
% From the graph the period of motion is pi. Mathmatically the period is
% 2*pi/omega0 and sense omega is 2 the period is pi.

% The mass will never come to rest in this equation. It will keep
% oscillating between .1 and -.1. This is because ther is no damping in the
% differential equation.

% *(d)*
% The amplititude of oscillations for y is .1.

% *(e)*
% The maximum velocity obtained by the mass is .2m/s. That veolcity is
% obtained every pi*(2n+1)/4 seconds for every positive integer n.

% The size of mass m and the stiffness k of the speing are inversely
% porpotional to each other, as k is divided by m to find omega. Thus a
% larger k or a smaller m will result in a larger omega value and a smaller
% period. Also a smaller k or larger m will result in a smaller omega value
% and a longer period.
