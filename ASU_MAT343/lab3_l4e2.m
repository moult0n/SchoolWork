% By definition a matrix is linearly independent iff the only solution to
% the homogenous matrix is the trivial one. The theorem is true because V
% is subspace of Rn. Therefore in order for all of the functions to exist
% in V all of there corresponding homogenous solution must be with in V by
% definition of a subspace.
